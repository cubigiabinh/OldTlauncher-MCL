 The Old Tlauncher from [MC-launcher](https://mc-launcher.com/). Why old?

Recently, [MC-launcher](https://mc-launcher.com/) make their Tlauncher installable. So, they no longer keep their portable Tlauncher on their server. That why this is old. This Tlauncher is official and completely portable.

Windows Versions: 7/8/10/11-32bit,64bit (If you want to Install on XP/Vista, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyRPUT4fXh4))
