 The Old Tlauncher from [MC-launcher]([Home - Mc-launcher.com](https://mc-launcher.com/)). Why old?

Recently, [MC-launcher]([Home - Mc-launcher.com](https://mc-launcher.com/)) make their Tlauncher installable. So, they no longer keep their portable Tlauncher on their server. That why this is old. This Tlauncher is official and completely portable.
